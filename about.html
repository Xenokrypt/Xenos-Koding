            <p id="desc1">Gaming brings me immense joy and satisfaction for various reasons. Firstly, it allows me to immerse myself in captivating virtual worlds, where I can embark on thrilling adventures and explore fantastical realms. The interactive nature of gaming provides an engaging and dynamic experience that keeps me entertained for hours. Moreover, gaming serves as a means of escape, offering a break from the stresses of everyday life and a chance to unwind and relax. It also provides a social outlet, as I can connect and interact with friends and fellow gamers, fostering a sense of community. Additionally, gaming stimulates my problem-solving skills and strategic thinking, as many games require strategic planning, quick decision-making, and adaptability. One of my favourite game would be Cyberpunk 2077. It had a rough start, but over its patches, i found it really entertaing and captivating while becoming really addicted to it, constantly wanting to play just so i could finish the story. Also it has the legendary Keanu Reeves in it. Who wouldnt want to play it??</p>

            <p id="desc1">I love to watch many Tv shows and Movies. But prehaps my favourite Tv show would be Game of Thrones. It kept me engaged the entire time wanting to watch one epsidoe after another, you get to explore a world where power plays a big part, and as an extra you get too see people get their heads chopped off and other really gory bits. You really fall in love with the characters (GOD FORBID IF I EVER MEET EMELIA CLARKE)...and the dragons along with the cities. I reccommend it, however we ignore the last season...we dont talk about that.</p>
